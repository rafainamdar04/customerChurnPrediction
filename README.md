## ðŸ›  Features & Workflow

- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis with interactive visualizations in Streamlit  
- Encoding categorical variables with LabelEncoder  
- Data balancing using SMOTE  
- Model training & cross-validation with Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost  
- Random Forest Classifier performed best and was chosen as the final model  
- Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- Save model and encoders for prediction use
